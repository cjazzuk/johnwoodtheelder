                <h2>Author: John Wood the Elder</h2>
<h2>Date: 1750</h2>
<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>In 1750 John Wood the Elder published his <i>A Dissertation upon the Orders of Columns, and their Appendages; the whole constituting the orders of architecture: interspersed with a brief account of the various kinds of intercolumnation observed by the antients. </i>It is a fascinating exploration of the classical orders of architecture, and their use in buildings throughout history.<br><br>In the book, Wood provides a detailed analysis of the three classical orders of architecture: Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian. He examines each order in turn, discussing their origins, key features, and typical uses in buildings. Wood also provides numerous examples of buildings that use each order, from ancient Greek temples to contemporary buildings in his own time.<br><br>One of the most interesting aspects of Wood's book is his discussion of the various ways in which the classical orders have been adapted and modified over time. He notes that while the basic principles of the orders have remained the same, architects have often experimented with different proportions, ornamentation, and other details to create new and unique buildings.<br><br>It is a valuable resource for anyone interested in the history of architecture, or in the classical orders in particular. His clear and concise writing style, combined with numerous illustrations and examples, make the book accessible and engaging for readers of all levels of expertise.<br><br>It can be read below or on <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/A_Dissertation_upon_the_Orders_of_Column/_hh9snIyksMC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=inauthor%3AJohn%20Wood%20the%20elder&amp;pg=PA1&amp;printsec=frontcover" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Books</a>.</p>

<p class="">Ancestor Homes has a very interesting article on <a href="https://www.ancestorhomes.com/news/house-history-an-in-depth-look-at-the-1764-conveyance-for-14-the-circus-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>House History: An in depth look at the 1764 Conveyance for 14 The Circus, Bath</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true"> </p>
<p class="">It provides an insight into how John Wood the Elder acquired the land The Circus is built on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="">The Conveyance then describes how John Wood acquired the land in the first place. Wood had purchased the land off <em>‘Thomas Garrard late of the Inner Temple London Esquire/since deceased/and Margaret his wife’</em> along with Samuel Purlewent, also a Gentleman of Bath, who had died by the time of the Conveyance. The parties had signed a deed dated 1 November 1754 for nine acres of land at a yearly rent of £163 (approximately £20,000 in today’s money).</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="">It goes on to also ensure that the exterior of the buildings that form the The Circus, Bath are to be uniform and adhere to the design:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="">The Conveyance then goes on to ensure the outside of all premises on the Circus is uniform. No chimneys could be altered without the consent of John Wood and stonework was to be cleansed and tombed so no cracks appeared. The deed also contains a clause about the colour of the woodwork; <em>‘the whole building may be of one colour and also shall and will paint all of the woodwork in the outside of the said messuage and also the outside street door with a quite white colour’.</em></p>
