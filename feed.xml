<p class="">Ancestor Homes has a very interesting article on <a href="https://www.ancestorhomes.com/news/house-history-an-in-depth-look-at-the-1764-conveyance-for-14-the-circus-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>House History: An in depth look at the 1764 Conveyance for 14 The Circus, Bath</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true"> </p>
<p class="">It provides an insight into how John Wood the Elder acquired the land The Circus is built on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="">The Conveyance then describes how John Wood acquired the land in the first place. Wood had purchased the land off <em>‘Thomas Garrard late of the Inner Temple London Esquire/since deceased/and Margaret his wife’</em> along with Samuel Purlewent, also a Gentleman of Bath, who had died by the time of the Conveyance. The parties had signed a deed dated 1 November 1754 for nine acres of land at a yearly rent of £163 (approximately £20,000 in today’s money).</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="">It goes on to also ensure that the exterior of the buildings that form the The Circus, Bath are to be uniform and adhere to the design:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="">The Conveyance then goes on to ensure the outside of all premises on the Circus is uniform. No chimneys could be altered without the consent of John Wood and stonework was to be cleansed and tombed so no cracks appeared. The deed also contains a clause about the colour of the woodwork; <em>‘the whole building may be of one colour and also shall and will paint all of the woodwork in the outside of the said messuage and also the outside street door with a quite white colour’.</em></p>

<p class="">Just under 3 miles North East from the centre of Bath is Upper Swainswick. Here at St Marys’s Church is the resting place of John Wood the Elder, his son and other family members. Across the valley is the wonderful <a href="https://www.johnwoodtheelder.co.uk/buckland-house-faringdon-2/">All Saints Church, Woolley</a> designed by John Wood the Younger.</p>
<p class="">The memorial slabs are being restored to bring back the wonderful lettering. A very minimal monument to the Georgian Architect who gave Bath the identity it has today.</p>
