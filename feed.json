He examines each order in turn, discussing their origins, key features, and typical uses in buildings. Wood also provides numerous examples of buildings that use each order, from ancient Greek temples to contemporary buildings in his own time.<br><br>One of the most interesting aspects of Wood's book is his discussion of the various ways in which the classical orders have been adapted and modified over time. He notes that while the basic principles of the orders have remained the same, architects have often experimented with different proportions, ornamentation, and other details to create new and unique buildings.<br><br>It is a valuable resource for anyone interested in the history of architecture, or in the classical orders in particular. His clear and concise writing style, combined with numerous illustrations and examples, make the book accessible and engaging for readers of all levels of expertise.<br><br>It can be read below or on <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/A_Dissertation_upon_the_Orders_of_Column/_hh9snIyksMC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=inauthor%3AJohn%20Wood%20the%20elder&amp;pg=PA1&amp;printsec=frontcover\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google Books</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" style=\"border: 0px;\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_hh9snIyksMC&amp;newbks=0&amp;dq=inauthor%3AJohn%20Wood%20the%20elder&amp;pg=PA1&amp;output=embed\"></iframe></div>",

The deed also contains a clause about the colour of the woodwork; <em>‘the whole building may be of one colour and also shall and will paint all of the woodwork in the outside of the said messuage and also the outside street door with a quite white colour’.</em></p>\n</blockquote>",
